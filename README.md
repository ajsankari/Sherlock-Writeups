# Sherlock HTB Writeups

Welcome to my the Sherlock HTB Writeups repository! This collection features detailed writeups for Sherlock challenges from Hack The Box (HTB), focusing on Unix log analysis, privilege escalation, and incident response. Each writeup provides a comprehensive breakdown of attack scenarios, log analysis techniques, and step-by-step solutions, helping you and I understand and solve these challenges effectively.
